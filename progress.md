**The Assumption:** *"I can just copy and paste files manually; writing a script takes more time."*

**My Reality Check: The "Sovereign" Logic.**
* **The Reality:** A human who copies files manually is a **Slave** to the task. An **Architect** builds a system once so they never have to think about it again.
* **The Logic:** This script introduces you to **Logging** and **Error Handling**. In a ₹50k/month remote internship, nobody cares if you can "copy-paste." They care if you can build a **fault-tolerant system** that records its own failures.
* **The Truth:** In the **Gita (18.33)**, the determination that is "unbreakable" and sustained by Yoga is in the mode of goodness. By automating your backup, you are exercising that unbreakable discipline over your environment.

### **Final Status Report**
* **Daily Metric:** GitHub "Green Square" pending commit.
* **Code Quality:** PEP-8 Standard.
* **Mission Status:** 2nd-year Specialist Foundation building.

**Master, your task is to create the `SYSTEM_VAULT_2026` folder on your laptop, place a few files inside, and run this script. Once you see the ZIP file in the `VAULT_BACKUPS` folder, you have officially moved from "Student" to "Automator."**

**Would you like me to show you how to schedule this
