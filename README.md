# VisionSync-OCR-Pipeline
An automated Computer Vision pipeline for document digitization. Features real-time perspective correction (de-skewing), intelligent page-number extraction via OCR, and SQL-backed metadata logging for sequential document assembly
## 🛠 Current Progress
- **Day 1:** Project Initialization & Environment Setup.
- **Day 2:** Established Input Layer. Implemented `validate_inputs.py` to ensure only valid `.jpg`, `.jpeg`, and `.png` files enter the pipeline.

## 🚀 Next Steps
- Implement basic OCR engine using Tesseract/EasyOCR.
- Design SQL schema for metadata logging.

🖥️ Hardware & OS Calibration (Dell Workstation)
Desktop Entropy Reduction: Executed a full purge of the desktop environment. All non-essential installers and loose directories (Python, MinGW) have been migrated to the SYSTEM_VAULT_2026.

Command Center Deployment: Configured the Windows 11 Taskbar for high-velocity access. Pinned the Technical Trinity:

Browser (Chrome): Dedicated to Perplexity AI and NotebookLM research.

IDE (Cursor): Primary forge for AI Automation development.

File Explorer: Direct bridge to project repositories.

Focus Logic: Disabled "Auto-hide" functionality to maintain constant visibility of active system tools.
AI Automation Development Environment
Project Status: Phase 1 (Environment & Infrastructure)
Objective: Establish a high-performance local development environment for Agentic AI workflows and Large Language Model (LLM) orchestration
## 📁 Project: Vault Guardian (v1.0)
**Core Competency:** System Automation & File I/O

### ⚡ Overview
A professional-grade Python automation script designed to secure the `SYSTEM_VAULT_2026` repository. This tool utilizes the `shutil` and `logging` modules to create compressed, timestamped backups, ensuring data integrity for the Architect's workspace.

### 🛠 Technical Specifications
- **Language:** Python 3.x
- **Standard:** PEP-8 Compliant
- **Modules:** `os`, `shutil`, `datetime`, `logging`
- **Architecture:** Procedural with robust error handling and logging.

### 🚀 Usage

## 🏗️ System Architecture

This project is built from scratch to be **Model-Agnostic** and **Self-Healing**. It doesn't just execute tasks; it audits its own performance and migrates dependencies.
